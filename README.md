(This repo is under development)
This repository includes the main topics of practical classes and provides MATLAB code for each exercise. The main topics of the activities are:
- Session 3: Flash
- Session 4: Binary Distillation
- Session 5: Multicomponent Distillation
- Session 6: Absorption
- Session 9: Liquid-Liquid

Respecting the privacy of the course material, the problem statements are only available on WeBeep. But the provided functions are capable of solving the majority of practices.
