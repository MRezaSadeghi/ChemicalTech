# Chemical Processes and Technologies.
(This repo is under development) 
This repository includes the main topics of practical classes and provides MATLAB code for each exercise. The main topics of the activities are:
- Session 3: Flash
- Session 4: Binary Distillation
- Session 5: Multicomponent Distillation
- Session 6: Absorption

Respecting the privacy of the course material, the problem statements are only available on WeBeep. But the provided functions are capable of solving the majority of practices.

## Disclaimer
Although these codes work for a variety of situations, they codes are just for guidance, and it is highly recommended to read and evaluate them carefully.

## Notes:
The Antoine function is written using natural logarithm regarding the question if you have to work with 10 log base, change `log` to `log10` and change `exp(.)` to `10.^(.)`.
